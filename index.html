        <p>
          Your website should help you to achieve your goals. It should help you to grow your business, and make it easier to run. Ultimately, a website is an investment, one that has the potential to give back to you many times more than what you put in.

          My job isn't to build a beautiful website (although that is part of it), or to create a work of art. My job isn't to use the latest, bleeding-edge technologies (although they can help).

            <p>
              When me and my wife were planning our wedding, we decided that it would be very convenient to have all of the wedding information in one spot. This website allowed guests to see the location of the venue on Google Maps, read about how I proposed, see who was in the wedding party, and even RSVP to the wedding itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was especially nice because we had the ceremony in Ontario, and then a smaller reception in Manitoba. Guests could easily find the information they needed, and it was done in a beautiful way that matched the theme and colours of our wedding.
